  http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=17676&group_id=1814&atid=7062

The controller around_filter measures resource growth per request:
  * elapsed time
  * memory growth
  * object count
  * garbage collection runs
  * garbage collection duration

Log info begins with "STATS: "

If you're running NewRelic RPM, a live object count sampler is enabled also.
